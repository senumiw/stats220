# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

1. I am undertaking a degree in Science majoring in **Psychology** and **Statistics**.
2. I am taking *STATS 220* because it is required for my major and seemed interesting.
3. I am interested in learning about data processing. 

* A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/QDqCMsjL38kAAAAC/tenor.gif)
